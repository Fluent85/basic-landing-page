# Basic-landing-page
This is a mobile friendly basic landing page that utilizes HTML and CSS.  This is the beginning of my comeback journey to becoming a Front-end developer in 2021.  I'm going to review the basics of html, css, and JavaScript and build on it.  
 
## Motivation

Become more familar with HTML 5 and CSS3.  Build my skills as a developer.  The ultimate goal is to become a Front-end developer in 2021.  I will be doing projects from freecodecamp.org and other resources in order to obtain my first developer position.  I built a basic landing page to become more familiar with how a landing page is created with html and css.  This is also a simple example of a potential clients business landing page.
